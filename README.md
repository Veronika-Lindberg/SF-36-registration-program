The SF-36 survey, with 36 questions, is used to follow health over time.
One of the great ideas of using a digital version of the survey, is that you will get an immediate feedback on your health, compared to the general population. You will see if your health is better or worse than others at your age. You can also track changes in your health over time, and share the results with your doctor.

The SF-36-registration-program was developed as part of my master thesis in Applied Statistics at NMBU in 2015. (https://www.nmbu.no/forskning/grupper/bioinformatikk-og-anvendt-statistikk-bias) In this project, both the SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to assess the effects of acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments.
