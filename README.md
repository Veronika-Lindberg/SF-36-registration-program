The SF-36 survey, with 36 questions, is used to follow health over time.
One of the great ideas of using a digital version of the survey, is that you will get an immediate feedback on your health, compared to the general population. You will see if your health is better or worse than others at your age. You can also track changes in your health over time, and share the results with your doctor.
